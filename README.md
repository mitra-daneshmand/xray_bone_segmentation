# X-ray Bone Segmentation

This repository contains the code and model for deep learning-based segmentation of knee bones from X-ray images. This segmentation model is a part of the methodology outlined in the paper entitled "Deep learning based detection of osteophytes in radiographs and magnetic resonance imagings of the knee using 2D and 3D morphology".
