# X-ray Bone Segmentation

This repository contains the code and model for deep learning-based segmentation of knee bones from X-ray images. This segmentation model is a part of the methodology outlined in the paper entitled "Deep learning based detection of osteophytes in radiographs and magnetic resonance imagings of the knee using 2D and 3D morphology".

## Results

- The segmentation model achieved an ASD of 0.01 ± 0.02 mm for femur and 0.02 ± 0.08 mm for tibia, indicating high accuracy in segmenting bone boundaries.
- The DSC scores were 98.88 ± 0.01 for femur and 98.59 ± 0.01 for tibia, demonstrating a high degree of similarity between predicted and ground truth masks.
